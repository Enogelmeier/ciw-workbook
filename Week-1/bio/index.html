        <p>Tried this out last year and it was a really tough year, but I'm back
           again to re-do all my work. I have a much better grasp and I'm happy
           to re-do all the basics</p>
        <p> I started at ACA last January and finished the first and second
          phases. After the second phase I realized there was a lot of the basics
          I wanted to go back to and try again. This is me going through everything again!</p>
        <p>Right now I currently am a Techinical Support Engineer for Zoho.
          I love my job but I'm really excited to learn more and I will get a
          full-time developer job.</p>
        <p>I've been spending a lot of my free-time coding again. Besides that I
        love to read, travel, climb, skydive and scuba dive. I'm always open for an
      adventure. </p>

<!--Flexbox was working pretty well. height and width wasn't affecting my image?-->
<!-- my paragraphs are really weird and impossible to read, this has to be my flexbox-->
<!-- changed the #text and p to float left and this fixed my disply problem-->
<!-- how to get the damn photos to re-size?-->
